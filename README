These are applescripts for Plex (http://plexapp.com/) which you can use as "Speakable Items".

Requires OS X Lion.

If you haven't played with the speech recognition yet, here is how you get started:
Open System preferences > speech
- switch "speakable items" on.
- choose microphone (I have mine on internal (I'm on a mbp))
- I have chosen to let it "Listen continuously with keyword"
- keyword is "optional before each command"
- keyword: Choose what you want here. For example "Computer". My keyword is "Mac".

So... what commands can you say? take a look in the folder ~/Library/Speech/Speakable Items/
All files in there are commands. If you say one of the names of the files, the speech recognition will open that file.

To add your own commands, you just need to add a file with your desired command as filename. 
What I do is create an apple script to do a specific thing and save it as a Script using applescript editor.


How to setup the scripts:
1. First you need to download and install the scripting addon XMLTools2 as the scripts depend on it.

2. Open Plex media manager and check out in which place the tv show section is. If it's the second section, 
then the section number is 2 and you don't have to change anything. If it's another number, you need to change 
the 3rd row in "Play TV Show.scpt".

3. add the files to the folder ~/Library/Speech/Speakable Items/

Done!
